# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website, built with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nanyx95/Personal-Website.git
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
